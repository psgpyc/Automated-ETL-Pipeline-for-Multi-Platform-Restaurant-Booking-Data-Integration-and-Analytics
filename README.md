# Automated ETL Pipeline for Multi-Platform Restaurant Booking Data Integration and Analytics

## Project Overview

Restaurant today relies on several booking platforms such as The Fork, Quandoo, Open Table, and Design My Nights. When a reservation is made through any of these channels, restaurants receive an immediate email notification, and each platform offers a dedicated web interface where current, past, and future bookings can be viewed. This system allows for real-time updates on guest reservations and historical data, which can be essential for managing capacity and planning operations. 

While these platforms are primarily booking toolsâ€”not full management systemsâ€”restaurants migrate the booking data into a centralized management system for operational efficiency. 

How do the restaurant do that? 

A common guess will be through APIs!

These booking platforms do offer APIs that can theoretically integrate with popular restaurant management systems.

Many restaurants(small and medium-sized) opt to manually migrate the incoming reservation data into their internal management system.

It is not ideal-- but hey, it works!

But we all know, human error and lack of a automated, centralised system severely hampers analytics capabilities, and strategic decision-making. 

This project implements an ETL pipeline orchestrated by Apache Airflow, designed to automate the whole process without human intervention. The pipeline seamlessly integrates reservation data from multiple platforms into a single, centralised warehouse.  </br>

Since,these booking platform do not provide API endpoints unless you are their customers, I have custom-built API endpoints that closely resembles their endpoints & webhooks, providing realistic representations of data structures and responses from popular reservation platforms such as TheFork, Quandoo, OpenTable, and SevenRooms.

Additionally, the project features an interactive Tableau dashboard providing real-time analytics, offering clear insights into booking trends, reservation patterns, and platform performance metrics to support informed business decisions.

Additionally, this project includes **FindTables**, a basic **Django-based restaurant booking system** that simulates real-world table reservations. Users can make and manage reservations through API endpoints and a **frontend**.

## How It Works

### Extract Booking Data
- Airflow DAGs receives **reservation data** from custom built webhooks in Django.
- Data is fetched in different formats (JSON, CSV) and standardized.

### Transform & Standardize
- Python scripts clean, validate, and standardize booking data.
- Ensures uniformity across seperate databases. 

### Load into Database
- Standardized data is stored in **PostgreSQL**.
- Enables **efficient querying** and integration with the dashboard.

### Dashboard Analysis
- Tableau visualizes:
  - **Booking trends** across platforms
  - **Occupancy rates** per restaurant
  - **Platform performance** comparisons

### FindTables - Django-Based Booking System
- Allows users to **simulate restaurant bookings** via API.
- Stores bookings in the central database.

### Webhook Simulation
- Simulates real-time booking updates from different platforms.
- Updates database whenever a **reservation is modified or canceled**.
